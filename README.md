# Aurora Launcher

Aurora Launcher is a standalone launcher for the Aurora client mod for Minecraft: Java Edition. It is designed around isolated installations, transparent behavior, low background overhead, and user control.

## Development status

This repository contains the Phase 0 foundation (a Tauri 2 desktop shell, a Svelte/TypeScript frontend, a typed native status command, and platform-correct managed-data path resolution) plus the Phase 1 state model: a small versioned launcher configuration persisted as JSON under the managed-data root, a validated instance domain model with a read-only instance registry, deterministic managed-path derivation, and a validated Aurora release-manifest data model.

Minecraft launching, Microsoft/Minecraft authentication, game installation, Fabric installation, Aurora downloads, instance creation, profiles, and updates are **not implemented**.
